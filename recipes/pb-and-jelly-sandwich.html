    <h3>The best sandwich of all time</h3>
    <p>
        I used to make this for myself all the time as a kid.
        From toddlers to michelin star chefs, anyone can prepare this and enjoy it at any point throughout the day.
        What's also great about this recipe is how it won't break the bank.
